# go-tsqlsh

...Because SQLCMD sucks.

## Summary

This project is a re-envisioning of [tsqlsh](https://twistingmercury.github.io/tsqlsh/).  I say 're-envisioning' and not 'port' because tsqlsh is far from being in a state for regular use.

The goal is the same, however; create a csql-like cli for MSSQL.
